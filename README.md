# Noter

Helps studies and open note exams by compiling all the trascripts from Youtube and 3C Media Solutions videos.
It also has the ability to pull out all the unique lecture slides and OCR's them creating a searchable PDF.

## Notice

Currently I'm refactoring and it will probably not work.

More documentation will come shortly.
